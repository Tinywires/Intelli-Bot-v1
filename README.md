Functions:
Line Follower Mode
Using the adjustable IR sensors, the Intelli Bot can detect and follow a black or white line on a surface. The sensors are strategically placed to ensure that the robot stays on course, even when the track turns sharply or varies in width. This mode helps users understand the basics of sensor integration and feedback loops in robotics.
Hand Avoider Mode
In this mode, the ultrasonic sensor detects objects or hands placed near the robot. If an object is detected within a certain range, the robot changes its direction to avoid it. This showcases how proximity sensing can be used to create more interactive, autonomous systems.
Hand Follower Mode
The Intelli Bot can also be programmed to follow a hand or object. As the ultrasonic sensor tracks the distance, the robot maintains a specific distance, making it useful for projects where the robot must follow a moving entity, such as personal assistants or interactive games.
Obstacle Avoidance Mode
In obstacle avoidance mode, the ultrasonic sensor scans the environment to detect obstacles in the robot’s path. When an object is detected, the robot stops, reverses, and changes its direction to find a clear path. This mode illustrates real-world applications in autonomous vehicles and robots.
Bluetooth Control Mode
By connecting to a smartphone via Bluetooth, users can manually control the robot’s movements, speed, and mode. This function transforms the Intelli Bot into a fully remote-controlled vehicle, ideal for creating custom games and exploring wireless communication protocols.
Development Platform
Beyond the predefined functions, the Intelli Bot serves as an excellent development board. The breadboard and Arduino Nano offer endless possibilities for expansion. Users can experiment with different sensors, actuators, and modules to create custom robots, from simple automation systems to complex autonomous machines.
